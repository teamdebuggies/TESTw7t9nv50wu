      ## Rationale
      # Architecture Rationale

## Chosen Cloud-Native Patterns and Components
1. **Microservices Architecture**: We propose breaking the monolithic transaction engine into smaller, independently deployable microservices. This will allow for greater scalability and maintainability, catering to various products such as merchant services and digital wallets.
2. **API Gateway**: It will handle all requests, allowing for better request routing and management while also enabling rate limiting and security features.
3. **Event-Driven Processing**: Implementing an event-driven architecture will help decouple services and improve scalability and responsiveness, particularly during peak transaction periods.
4. **Docker Containerization**: Each service will be containerized to ensure consistency across environments and facilitate deployment via CI/CD pipelines.
5. **AWS Services**: Utilizing AWS managed services like RDS, Lambda, and S3 for data storage, serverless processing, and logging will reduce operational overhead and enhance security.

## Technology Decisions and Justification
- **Using AWS**: Given the need for rapid scalability and cost-effectiveness, AWS provides a resilient cloud platform with scalable services suited for fintech applications.
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**: This choice ensures a streamlined, automated deployment process, enhancing development speed and reliability while supporting automated testing to reduce rollbacks.

## Benefits
- **Scalability**: The proposed architecture supports horizontal scaling, accommodating increased transaction volumes during peak hours without performance degradation.
- **Cost-Efficiency**: By utilizing AWS managed services, operational costs are minimized as we only pay for what we use.
- **Security and Compliance**: The architecture aligns with PCI DSS requirements and industry best practices, ensuring data is securely managed and retained.
- **Resilience**: The distributed nature of the architecture improves fault tolerance and recovery time during outages, enhancing customer trust.

## Alignment with Industry and Environment Context
This architecture not only addresses the urgent need to enhance performance and reliability but also positions the fintech startup as a competitive entity in the enterprise-grade payment solution market, enhancing trust and operational efficiency.

The updates reflect the separation of database clusters for better scalability and reliability. This allows both Service 1 and Service 2 to operate independently while sharing the same load balanced API Gateway. This architecture enhances fault tolerance.

      ## Architectural Decision Record (ADR)
      # Architectural Decision Record

## Problem(s) to Solve
The current application experiences significant latency spikes and timeouts, lacks observability, and does not meet security and compliance standards, affecting customer trust and operational efficiency.

## Analysis Performed
We analyzed the monolithic architecture and consulted industry best practices for payment solutions. We assessed the need for scalability, security, compliance, and efficient transaction processing under varying loads.

## Decision and Justification
We decided to migrate to a microservices architecture using AWS services. This approach will provide scalability, better performance during peak transactions, align with PCI DSS compliance, and enhance observability and operational efficiency through event-driven processing and CI/CD automation.

Architectural Decision: Introduced separate database clusters for Service 1 and Service 2 for resilience and scalability. Previously, both services were using a single database instance, which created a bottleneck during peak loads. The decision was made to enhance performance and maintainability.
